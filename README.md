## Framework for multi-view predictive visual analytics for a Customer Due Diligence report

•	Developed a novel framework for predictive visual analytics by leveraging structured and unstructured data. 
•	Achieved to increase the accuracy of the model while augmenting domain experts’ capabilities with an interpretable model. 

In this thesis, we propose a multi-view semi-supervised framework for a risk classification task in a Customer Due Diligence (CDD) report. The CDD report helps the financial institutions to screen new applicants and existing customers against restricted entities, sanctions lists and highrisk parties to label high risk customers; it is a vital element to protect and shield the financial system against illegal activities.

While financial crime is growing in scale and complexity, we need to keep the pace and develop more efficient solutions that leverage all the available growing customer data. This leaded us to study and choose the co-training algorithm as it has been demonstrated in the past that it outperforms single-view learning schemas. It also allows us to leverage a big amount of unlabeled data while having the opportunity to choose the most suitable classifier for each view (text and transactions).

The proposed framework aims to augment the capabilities of CDD experts to perform their work more efficiently and in a more effective way. We want to do this by providing not only accurate classifications but also an interpretable model, that explains why and how the prediction was done. Further, we exploit the properties of a visual analytics design to provide meaningful insight and to have humans (domain experts) in the CDD process.

We demonstrated that our co-training proposal outperforms a single classifier schema and other setups. It also provides a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Based on empirical results, we also found the combination of initial training instances and number of iterations that produces the best performance. In addition to this, we showed empirical evidence that our visual analytics tool improves the knowledge available to CDD experts by showing relevant information in a simple and intuitive manner.

The framework will increase the insight and the tools available to CDD experts, and will allow them to optimize the resources by focusing on high-risk customers that are highlighted by our co-training proposal. Furthermore, the model will support one of the main financial institution’s goals: be a rock solid bank.
